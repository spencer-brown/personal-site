    h1 Notes on&nbsp;
      em How to Win Friends and Influence People
    h4 1/20/2017
  
    p These are notes on each of the book's chapters, in order. I've sometimes included quotes that I found interesting but which may not contribute directly to that chapter's purpose. Sometimes I've included just the chapter's principle. Other times, I've included quotes that I came across in the middle of the chapter that I found to be sufficient for that chapter's principle.
    p I found the book somewhat repetitive this time 'round, but I'd still recommend it to just about anyone. Many of its principles are plain gold in my experience.
    p These notes are for my personal reference, but I thought I'd share them in case they're helpful for anyone else. I plan to return to these notes in the future instead of re-reading the book again.
